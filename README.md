- 👋 Hi, I’m @rylac, but really I'm Ryan Lacarne, B.Sc. Data Science candidate and working at a logistics startup in data architecture.
- 👀 I’m really interested in web scraping, sports analytics, creating meaningful visualizations, and answering random questions through data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL, VBA, and various tools and technologies that help me in my day-to-day operations at work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating the first of its kind sports database to be used for analytics/predictions/etc.
